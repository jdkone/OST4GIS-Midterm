        <h1>2013</h1>
        <p>Although the State of Colorado voted to legalize recreational cannabis in 2012, commercial sales to the public did not commence until 2014.</p>

      <div class="slide" id="slide2">
        <h1>2014</h1>
        <p>Due to the lag between the vote for legalizing cannabis and the final rollout of regulations and approvals, many retailers began setting up shop prior to 2014. As a result, there was an explosion of cannabis retailers operating once the law took effect. This map shows the locations of all active retailers in 2014, with 671 in total.</p>

        <h1>2017</h1>
        <p>In 2017, three years after legalization, there were 903 active retailers in Denver. As the growth rate continues to slow, it seems Denver's cannabis industry may be reaching peak saturation.</p>
